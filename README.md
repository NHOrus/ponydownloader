Attempt to learn go and exploit derpiboo.ru public api to batch download files concurrently.

Current version gets a number of image and saves it in current directory

There are ways to go, but it provides minimal functionality as of now


config.ini

Secion [main]

key => your derpiboo.ru key

./bin directory
